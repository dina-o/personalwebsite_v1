#  ⁠— how do you do? 

Check out my first iteration of my personal website now at: [dinaorucevic.design](dinaorucevic.design). <br> I wanted to give the website a minimalist, yet personal feel so my creativity and development skills could shine through ⛅
 

Built with js, html, css and lots of love ^_^

**Thanks for stopping by!** <br> <br>

*note: mobile version coming soon...*
